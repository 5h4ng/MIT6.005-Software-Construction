# Reading 12-Abstract Data Types

## What Abstraction Means

**Terms:**

- **Abstraction**. Omitting or hiding low-level details with a simpler, higher-level idea.
- **Modularity**. Dividing a system into components or modules, each of which can be designed, implemented, tested, reasoned about, and reused separately from the rest of the system.
- **Encapsulatioin**. Building walls around a module (a hard shell or capsule) so that the module is responsible for its own internal behavior, and bugs in other parts of the system can't damage its integrity.
- **Information hiding**. Hiding details of a module's implementation from the rest of the system, so that those details can be changed later without changing the rest of the system.
- **Separation of concerns**. Making a feature (or 'concern') the responsibility of a single module, rather than spreading it across multiple modules.
